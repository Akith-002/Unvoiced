# IMMEDIATE FIX FOR CELL 7 IN YOUR KAGGLE NOTEBOOK

# Replace the "Combine histories" section with this code:

```python
# Combine histories - FIXED VERSION
combined_history = {}

# Debug: Check what keys are available
print("üîç Available history keys:")
print("Phase 1:", list(history_phase1.history.keys()))
print("Phase 2:", list(history_phase2.history.keys()))

# Get all unique keys from both phases
all_keys = set(history_phase1.history.keys()) | set(history_phase2.history.keys())
print(f"All keys: {sorted(all_keys)}")

# Combine histories safely
for key in all_keys:
    if key in history_phase1.history and key in history_phase2.history:
        # Both phases have this key - combine them
        combined_history[key] = history_phase1.history[key] + history_phase2.history[key]
        print(f"‚úÖ Combined {key}: {len(combined_history[key])} values")
    elif key in history_phase1.history:
        # Only phase 1 has this key - pad with zeros for phase 2
        phase1_len = len(history_phase1.history[key])
        phase2_len = len(history_phase2.history['loss'])  # Use loss as reference length
        combined_history[key] = (history_phase1.history[key] +
                               [history_phase1.history[key][-1]] * phase2_len)
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  {key} only in phase 1, padded for phase 2")
    elif key in history_phase2.history:
        # Only phase 2 has this key - pad with zeros for phase 1
        phase1_len = len(history_phase1.history['loss'])  # Use loss as reference length
        phase2_len = len(history_phase2.history[key])
        combined_history[key] = ([history_phase2.history[key][0]] * phase1_len +
                               history_phase2.history[key])
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  {key} only in phase 2, padded for phase 1")

print(f"‚úÖ Training completed! Combined history has {len(combined_history)} metrics")
```

# ALTERNATIVE SIMPLE FIX (if above is too complex):

```python
# Simple fix - just use phase 2 history
combined_history = {}
for key in history_phase2.history.keys():
    combined_history[key] = history_phase1.history.get(key, []) + history_phase2.history[key]

print("‚úÖ Training completed!")
```
